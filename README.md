## Description
This repository is the code for the research paper "Dynamic Split Computing Framework for Multi-Task Learning Models: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", which is currently under the submission process

## How to use
First, if you run the files such as Effect of Bandwidth.py, Effect of Cost weight.py, Effect of The number of Models.py, and Effect of The size of intermediate data.py, these files automatically generate the results.
After that, you can see the results in each folder, e.g., Bandwidth, Cost, Model, and Intermediate.
